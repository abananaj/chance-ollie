            <p>Life happens and plans change. When you purchase Ticket Insurance during checkout, you have the freedom to exchange your ticket(s) to a different performance for no additional fee (which is usually $15 per ticket). You also have the option of receiving a full credit in to redeem later for tickets, merchandise, or a donation (no expiration date!). We do not offer refunds, even with the purchase of ticket insurance and Ticket Insurance is not available for PWYC (Pay What You Can) tickets. <strong>There will be no exchanges within 24 hours of your performance start time, with or without Ticket Insurance. </strong></p>

            <p>To cause the fewest disruptions, patrons who have not entered the theater prior to the end of the curtain speech will be asked to wait in the lobby until an appropriate break in the performance for the benefit of other audience members and the performers. Latecomers, and patrons who leave the theater anytime during the performance, may be assisted to alternate seats by the House Manager at an appropriate time and may then take their assigned seats at intermission.</p>
